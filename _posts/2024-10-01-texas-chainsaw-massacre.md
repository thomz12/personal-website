I helped out on platform specific features for the PlayStation version of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Details for this I probably cannot disclose yet though, so more on that later!

I've also helped development on a similair game from the same publisher, Friday the 13th: The Game. This was briefly when I first started on Stage games and was great experience. While I was only on it for doing some maintanance and bug fixing, it was a nice way to get familiar with console development.
