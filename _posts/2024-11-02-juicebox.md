Juicebox is my personal engine project that has been going on for a while. I started developement in C#/.NET and eventually moved to C++. Here I'll go in a bit more detail what I've done!

## Juicebox C#
The original version of my engine, which I'm referring to as Juicebox C#, I started around 2018. It started when I was tasked with porting an other C#/DirectX game engine to the web. I needed a small proof of concept to see if it would work, and I kept adding to it until around 2022. 

It used Bridge.NET (and later [h5](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/h5)) to compile C# to JavaScript so games could be run in many web browsers. I created a WebGL graphics implementation to allow for hardware accelarated graphics, mostly 2D. Unlike many of the the big engines, it also supported phones and tablets through browser to allow for easy sharing of the games created with it.

### The positives
- Cross platform support out of the box across many devices
- Performance was very good, even running on older hardware and browsers
- Programming in a type-safe language
- Worked together very well with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) & [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
- 

### Improvements
- Limited by deprecated compiler (Bridge.NET)
- Game code needs to be compiled every time
- Didn't run nativly on devices (But through Electron/Cordova)
  - Mostly because maintaining different platforms would take a lot of time
- Scenes and UI are defined in code

## Juicebox C++
After running into limitations with the C# compiler, I figured I would
