Juicebox is my personal engine project that has been going on for a while. I started developement in C#/.NET and eventually moved to C++. 
Here I'll go in a bit more detail what I've done!

## Juicebox C#
The original version of my engine, which I'm referring to as Juicebox C#, I started around 2018. It started when I was tasked with porting an other C#/DirectX game engine to the web. I needed a small proof of concept to see if it would work, and I kept adding to it until around 2022. 

It used Bridge.NET (and later [h5](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/h5)) to compile C# to JavaScript so games could be run in many web browsers. I created a WebGL graphics implementation to allow for hardware accelarated graphics, mostly 2D. Unlike many of the the big engines, it also supported phones and tablets through browser to allow for easy sharing of the games created with it.

### The positives
- Cross platform support out of the box across many devices
- Performance was very good, even running on older hardware and browsers
- Programming in a type-safe language
- Worked together very well with other software like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) & [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
- Everything ran in a browser

### Improvements
- Limited by deprecated transpiler (Bridge.NET)
- Game logic needs to be compiled every time
- Didn't run nativly on devices, only in browser or through Electron/Cordova
  - Mostly because maintaining different platforms would take a lot of time
- Scenes and UI are defined in code, making it difficult to quickly visualize changes
  - Though eventually level editing could be done in `Tiled`

## Juicebox C++
After running into limitations with the deprecated C# to JavaScript transpiler, I figured I would need to look for alternatives.
One of the alternatives was using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and while it is a good
alternative a lot had to change to make it work. I already had many things I wanted to change anyway so I eventually decided to rewrite
the engine in C++ instead. I had a couple of reasons for that:
- I wanted to learn more C++, and this might be the biggest reason for the switch.
- Most libraries can be used and compiled to platforms directly.
- Easier to nativly support platforms, including consoles and phones.
- On web, I can compile to web assembly.

Currently I got Juicebox running nativly on:
<ul>
  <li><i class="fa-brands fa-microsoft"></i> Windows</li>
  <li><i class="fa-brands fa-apple"></i> MacOS</li>
  <li><i class="fa-brands fa-linux"></i> Linux</li>
  <li><i class="fa-brands fa-html5"></i> Web</li>
  <li><i class="fa-brands fa-android"></i> Android</li>
</ul>

And I intent to support more once I have time for it.

### Juicebox Editor
This time I really wanted an editor for creating games. This would hopefully make it easier to create games with the engine, even for
people that can't do any programming. Currently, the editor and runtime are seperate executables and pre-compiled. So to create a game
there is no need to compile any C++ code. Game logic is instead defined with Lua scripts. Playback can be simulated right in the editor
for quick iteration and is very much [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).

The editor specifically runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS and in Web browsers so games can be worked on across platforms. Some editor
behaviour can also be extended with Lua scripts on a project level, so different projects can have custom behaviour suited to their needs.

### Juicebox Runtime
The runtime uses projects that are output from the editor to run a game. There is not much you need to change across platforms and
everything should just work. You can of course change behaviour between platforms if you need to. The runtime is what gets distributed
to players and depending on the platform resources are packed automatically. On android and web everything will get packed into a archive
for example, but the engine automatically takes care of that for you.

### Games made with Juicebox C++
Currently, I made two games with the C++ version of Juicebox. Both are [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) (game jam) games, and I have learned a lot each time
I participated about how I can improve the engine. Due to the time constraints of the game jam, anything that isn't clear or just takes
time to do will get noticed and I will try to improve that for next time. 

The games I created with Juicebox C++ are:
- [Patty Panic](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/patty-panic) in 48 hours for the Compo
- [Bunny Wrangler](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56/bunny-wrangler) in 72 hours for the Jam

## The Juice in Juicebox
I think it is important to make a lot of things in the game easy to react in some way, usually visually. That's why both the C# and C++
version made it very easy to 'juice' things. Usually in response to player input, or something happening in the world. It usually should
help the player realize their input is recognized and are doing the right or wrong thing. This is mostly done by using coroutines to
create functions that are automatically called every frame over a given period of time.
