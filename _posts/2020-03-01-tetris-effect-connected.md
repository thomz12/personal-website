One of my responsibilities was to get Tetris Effect running on the Xbox One, the then not yet released Xbox Series X/S, and with the Windows Store.
It was a very interesting project to work on, especially since it was a launch title for the new Xbox. 
We worked on the 'Connected' part of the game, which was the new multiplayer functionality that wasn't in the original version.

After a successful release of the Xbox version, I worked on the cross-play functionality between all the platforms. This also included the PlayStation consoles, Nintendo Switch, Meta (Oculus) Quest, and Windows. 
Epic's software we used for networking was very new and had very limited support on the newer consoles and with Unreal, which made for an interesting challenge.
