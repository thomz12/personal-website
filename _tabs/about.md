Hallo! I'm Thom Zeilstra, originally from the Netherlands and currently a game developer at Stage Games in Tokyo. My primary focus is tackling the technical challenges of making games work seamlessly across various platforms, including major consoles, desktops, and mobile phones.

I have had the privilege of working on some notable titles:
- Insurgency: Sandstorm
- Friday the 13th & The Texas Chain Saw Masaccare
- Tetris Effect: Connected
- Guilty Gear -Strive-
- Pok√©mon

My expertise lies in programming with C++ and C#, but I'm also proficient in several other languages such as Lua, Python, and JavaScript.

In my spare time I usually work on my own game engine, which I frequently use for game jams such as the Ludum Dare. You'll find more about it browsing this website if you're intrested!
